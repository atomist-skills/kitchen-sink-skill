Well, nothing. But it can be good for testing!

7.  **Commit Strategy**

    ![Fix strategy](docs/images/commit-strategy.png)

    Choose how to apply copyright and license updates to the repository. The
    following options are available:

    -   **Raise pull request for default branch; commit to other branches** -
        with this option, fixes on the default branch will be submitted via a
        pull request; fixes on other branches will be committed straight onto
        the branch
    -   **Raise pull request for default branch only** - with this option, fixes
        on the default branch will be submitted via a pull request; fixes on
        other branches will not be persisted
    -   **Raise pull request for any branch** - with this option, fixes on all
        branches will be submitted via a pull request
    -   **Commit to default branch only** - with this option, fixes on the
        default branch will be committed straight to the branch; fixes on other
        branches will not be persisted
    -   **Commit to any branch** - with this option, fixes on all branches will
        be committed straight to the branch


    Pull requests that get raised by this skill will automatically have a
    reviewer assigned based on the person who pushed code. Pull requests that
    are not needed any longer, i.e., because all lint violations were fixed
    manually, are closed automatically.
